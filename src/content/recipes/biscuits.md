description: |
  This recipe used to be on the side of the powdered buttermilk can, but it doesn't seem to be anymore.
  If you want to make this with liquid buttermilk, use ⅔ cup of that instead of the water. They're cheating
  by using a higher powdered buttermilk/water ratio than they recommend for liquid buttermilk substitution,
  so it might be less "buttermilky" if you do that.
