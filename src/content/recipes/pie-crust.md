title: Pie crust
description: |
  Vodka is the magic ingredient in my pie crusts. Adding vodka to
  the crust makes it easier to work with, but cooks out while baking,
  leaving less moisture behind for a nice flaky crust. Adding vodka
  to the chef tends to reduce the quality of my crusts, but your
  results may vary.
ingredients:
  - amount: Â¼ cup
    name: butter
    detail: cold
  - amount: 1 cup
    name: flour
  - amount: 3 Tbsp
    name: vodka
  - name: water
    amount: 1 Tbsp
    detail: or more, if needed

Cut butter and flour together using a fork or pastry cutter until it resembles a coarse meal.

Add vodka and 1 Tbsp. water to make a soft dough. Do not overwork it. Add more water, 1 Tbsp. at a time, if needed.

Roll out and line a pie dish. Refrigerate if not used immediately. I don't usually pre-bake my crusts, and everything turns out just fine.

If you accidentally make a hole, take some extra from a lumpy edge and patch it up. I won't tell anyone.
